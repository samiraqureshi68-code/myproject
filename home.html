 <h2>Marketing brief</h2>
 <P>Market Briefing: Garnier India<br><br>

<b>1. Market Size & Growth:<br><br></b>
India’s beauty and personal-care market in 2024 was approximately USD 28 billion and is expected to grow to USD 48 billion. The hair-care and skin-care segments are growing rapidly. The hair-care market in India is estimated to reach USD 4.89 billion by 2025. There is significant scope for growth in the premium segment although the majority of the market belongs to “mass-market” products.

<br><br>

<b>2. Garnier’s Positioning & Opportunity :<br><br></b>

  Garnier India operates in a key growth market. The company aims to expand into new markets. Hair color and female skincare are the strongest segments, while male skincare is also rising — hair color enjoys more than 20% market share. Consumer trends show that young, digitally aware, and value-conscious consumers prefer natural, plant-based ingredients, cruelty-free claims, and sustainability.
<br><br><b>3. Key Drivers for Growth:</b><br><br>

Urbanization, higher disposable income, and digital adoption are driving sales of beauty products. The role of online/direct-to-consumer channels is expanding. E-commerce beauty sales are steadily increasing. Consumers prefer “natural,” “green beauty,” and “sustainable packaging” themes. Garnier’s sustainability initiatives align well with these preferences.
<br><br>

<b>4. Key Challenges & Focus Areas:</b><br><br>

 Sustainability remains a key focus area. There is also a challenge in educating Indian consumers regarding digital adoption and sustainable beauty choices. The market is price-sensitive, so affordable product offerings are crucial. Compliance with evolving regulations, counterfeiting in e-commerce, and addressing regional diversity in consumer preferences are important focus areas.
<br><br><b>5. Garnier’s Strategic Focus:</b><br><br>Innovation in product formulations, use of digital adoption for beauty product marketing, and increasing online/direct-to-consumer channels are significant. Garnier India continues to align its sustainability initiatives with global standards and local consumer preferences, focusing on natural ingredients, eco-friendly packaging, and cruelty-free products.
